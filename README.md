I decided to create a website for the student union of Westminster International University in Tashkent. On behalf of the rector, I made it back in August and decided to supplement it and add it as a Pat project to my portfolio. The site contains 6 pages

The home page is the focal point, a thoroughfare that contains most of the important data. It acts as the entrance to the student union's digital universe, providing a peek of its vibrant environment. 'About Us,' the second page, goes into further detail about the union's basic characteristics and offers insightful information about its goals, mission, and the committed people guiding it.

The third page, 'Get Involved,' provides an essential platform for individuals who are keen to join and interact. Not only can people get information on how to get in touch with the Student Union here, but they can also discover a handy form for easy communication. 'Representation,' the fourth page, provides openness and accessibility to the leadership structure by revealing the minute information of the Students Union Executives and their advisers.

The emphasis is shifted to the varied fabric of university clubs and communitiesâ€”on page five. When you click on any specific club, you'll be sent to page six, which provides a detailed look at the goals, activities, and lively community that each group promotes.

The website, an exemplar of digital artistry, is consistent with the overarching goal of promoting cohesion and knowledge exchange among academics. The project adds a new dimension to my portfolio by demonstrating both technical skill and a dedication to improving the whole educational experience.
